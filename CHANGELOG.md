# Changelog

## 2026-10-02
- Rebuilt Linux QuickStart as a single bootstrap script and short interactive wizard.
- Bundled application images in release assets instead of depending on private GHCR visibility.
- Added generated HTTPS for VM setup and image checksum/identity verification.
- Preserved non-root installation and existing data.

## 2026-10-02 — Automatic non-root prerequisites
install.sh now downloads rootless Docker 29.8.2 and Compose v2.39.4 automatically, starts the user service, and downloads/extracts missing Python, OpenSSL and iptables packages under the user's home using Debian/Ubuntu package sources without APT installation or sudo. It saves the Docker environment for subsequent logins and includes the TROA welcome/support/project message. System UID mapping helpers, assigned subordinate ID ranges, enabled user namespaces, package indexes and an active user systemd login must exist in the VM image; missing requirements are listed precisely. Unattended operation requires user lingering provisioned in that image. This is not a claim of zero host prerequisites or completed clean-VM acceptance.


## 2026-10-02 — Dedicated service account
The explicit --prepare-account mode performs only administrator-owned account preparation: creates bifrost with its own group and initially locked password, checks UID and privileged memberships and sudo policy, protects its home and enables user lingering. It refuses an existing privileged account without altering its groups or grants. Set a login password with passwd bifrost and log in directly as bifrost. Normal installation now requires bifrost and rejects sudo/wheel/docker/lxd/incus-admin membership and discoverable sudo grants. Application installation and services remain non-root; administrator preparation does not install or run the application. Bash syntax checked; real VM account acceptance pending.
